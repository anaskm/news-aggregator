The majority of the players in the Liverpool squad played for Matt Beard last season and given the shock news of death it would be very understandable if they felt unable to play. Hopefully any Liverpool fans who had set off for Birmingham hadn’t made it too far with their journey. Following the tragic death of former manager Matt Beard, Liverpool have released a short statement confirming that their WSL clash with Aston Villa, which was due to take place at midday, has been postponed. Here is the statement in full: Following the sudden and tragic news of the passing of former LFC Women manager Matt Beard, the match at Villa Park – scheduled for 12pm BST – will not take place. Details of a rearrangement will be confirmed in due course. I’ve had a little trip below the line, hello you lovely lot, this comment piqued my interest: Do you Gooners feel Duderonomy is deluded?

Marseille v PSG: a rivalry that is more about old records than recent results For Le Classique, we have a great read from the Guardian Sport Network as Luke Entwistle of Get French Football News writes about how PSG have now snatched the last bragging right away from Marseille fans. Even as the Parisians were racking up league titles, OM could always say they were France’s only European champions, but not any more… Read Luke Entwistle’s full preview via the link below There are some absolutely massive games across Europe today. We will be providing goal updates from the Rome derby in this blog when that kicks off at 11.30am BST. We will get team news from the Stadio Olimpico in about an hour. There is also Le Classique tonight (7.45pm BST) in Ligue 1 as Marseille host PSG at Stade Velodrome, that will be some spectacle. Roberto De Zerbi’s collection of former Premier League talents have been troublingly inconsistent so far this season, PSG have four wins from four games, still it’s at the Velodrome. In Spain, Barcelona already have ground to make up on Real Madrid, who continued their perfect start to the season last night by beating Espanyol 2-0. Marcus Rashford reminded everyone why he plays for Barcelona at Newcastle in midweek, he will be hoping for more of the same against Getafe tonight (8pm BST). To the Bundesliga where Harry Kane scored another hat-trick (although the German I’m not sure it met the slightly baffling criteria for a hat-trick in Germany) as Bayern Munich won 4-1 at Hoffenheim. Should Borussia Dortmund want to hang on to the coattails of the Bavarians they will need to overcome Wolfsburg at Signal Iduna Park, where Christian Eriksen could make his debut for the visitors (6.30pm BST). The first email of the blog today comes from krishnamoorthy v, who writes: Hello Tom, How often does one get to see a Arsenal-City clash in which the latter is the underdog? If Arsenal blow this, as usual, then they may have to resign to the old saying, slightly adapted: ‘Class is temporary, but second place is permanent’. While I would argue that Arsenal in the past few seasons have always been considered at least the bookies’ favourite going into home matches against City, but I think the spirit of the question still stands. So, on that, the City malaise that set in last season has removed that aura of invincibility and having seen them in person this season, they simly aren’t as scary as they used to be. I don’t think even a defeat would consign Arsenal to second, but they do need to come out and attack this game. If it turns it into a battle of set-pieces and fine margins then it will be closer than it should be, whereas an early assault could demoralise a fragile City side that are yet to truly convince. Manchester United’s fast WSL start can’t mask growing apathy and frustration Manchester United sit top of the Women’s Super League, albeit two games in. A 3-1 aggregate win over the Norwegian side Brann on Thursday ensured they escaped the Champions League qualifying stage for the first time. The new signing Jess Park has hit the ground running. Elisabeth Terland has scored two hat-tricks. This should be fuelling positivity and hope, but not even the impressive start can cut through the cloud of disillusionment and frustration felt by fans and those watching the club from further afield. Why does this growing apathy exist? Why, even if United beat the European champions, Arsenal, at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday, will it not go away? In part, because of a feeling of missed opportunity. United have, arguably, overachieved, regularly challenging at the top of the WSL and reaching three FA Cup finals in the past three years, winning the competition in 2024. They are operating on a much smaller budget than Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City and their potential is being harmed by an ownership that appears not to care. Read Suzanne Wrack’s full preview of Manchester United v Arsenal via the link below For the showpiece fixture in the WSL this afternoon between Manchester United and Arsenal, the excellent Emillia Hawkins will be bringing you full live coverage, we shall where you can find that blog as soon as it goes live. As noted earlier, there are three midday (BST) kick-offs in the WSL and you will be able to get updates on all the goals in this very blog with my esteemed colleague John Brewin, so don’t go anywhere. I will bring you team news from those as soon as it lands, hot and fresh off from the various inkjet printers across the country. Arteta to stick with impressive Mosquera? The praise has been flooding in for Cristhian Mosquera after his impressive performance against Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday. “He’s still so young,” said Jurriën Timber after Arsenal’s 2-0 win. “It looks so easy for him, winning his duels and on the ball as well. It’s great to have him next to me, and he has a bright future as well.” Signed from Valencia for an initial £13m, the Spain Under-21s international looks like one of best value summer deals having filled in admirably for the injured William Saliba. The Frenchman has been back in training this week after limping off at Liverpool with an ankle injury before the international break. The question is whether Mikel Arteta will bring Saliba back or stick with Mosquera for the meeting with Manchester City. Arsenal v Manchester City, 4.30pm Roefs’ excellence bars Villa’s path Will Sunday’s trip to the Stadium of Light prove to be the start of a positive reset for Aston Villa? Or could it signal the beginning of the biggest crisis of Unai Emery’s tenure? Emery’s cause would be aided appreciably if his side could score a first league goal of the season. The only problem is that Sunderland have collected seven points from their opening four league games and possess the outstanding Robin Roefs in goal. They say there are no steals in the European transfer market any more but the 22-year-old cost a modest initial £9m, potentially rising to £11.5m, when Sunderland signed him from NEC Nijmegen this summer. On the convincing evidence of his first four games it is no surprise that a keeper who has played for the Netherlands at every junior level and starred for the under-21s in the recent European Championship has now graduated to the Dutch senior squad. Sunderland v Aston Villa, 2pm Handling Woltemade is a tall order Three-quarters of Bournemouth’s first-choice defence departed the club this summer in Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi but, after three wins from four, the Cherries seem stronger than ever. The ease with which the 18-year-old centre-back Veljko Milosavljevic has slotted in alongside his partner Marcos Senesi has been striking; the new signing signed for the club on deadline day and made only 27 first-team appearances for Red Star Belgrade before his £13m move to the Premier League. Milosavljevic marshalled Danny Welbeck and Stefanos Tzimas expertly in the win against Brighton but if the Serb retains his place ahead of another of Bournemouth’s new additions, Bafodé Diakité, he faces a different prospect altogether in Nick Woltemade. The 6ft 6in Newcastle striker showed against Wolves he is an aerial threat and a nimble forward able to link the play, somewhere between a classic No 9 and a second striker. Containing the big German will be key in deciding if Bournemouth continue their excellent start. Bournemouth v Newcastle, 2pm Here’s a few preview notes on today’s Premier League fixtures from our team of writers… Andoni Iraola is a model modern manager. Could he save Manchester United? You have to be patient with new players. You have to give a manager time to work with fresh signings, let them learn his methods. Rome wasn’t built in a day – Brian Clough quipped he wasn’t on that particular job, but it took until the third season at Derby and Nottingham Forest to win promotion. It makes sense; you have to wait. Football takes time. Or you could just turn to Andoni Iraola. Iraola lost three of his back four in the summer and his goalkeeper. (No detail perhaps so encapsulates the financial landscape of modern European football better than the highest fees paid in the latest transfer window by a Spanish club and a French one were for Bournemouth centre-backs. His third-highest non-penalty goalscorer from last season left as well. The expectation might have been of a season, at least a few weeks, of transition, but Bournemouth have, for the first time in the top flight, won three of their first four games. Read Jonathan Wilson’s full ‘Inside football’ column via the link below After such tragic news, your regular football fodder feels rather trite, but there was action on the field yesterday, including a win for Liverpool’s men’s team in Merseyside derby against Everton. Here’s a quick recap: Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitike scored to in that 2-1 win over Everton that maintains Liverpool’s perfect start to the season Jack Grealish and David Moyes criticised referee Darren England over the amount of stoppage time in the derby A fiery clash at Old Trafford saw Manchester United beat Chelsea 2-1, in game where Robert Sanchez was dismissed after five minutes and Casemiro scored before later seeing red himself Spurs fought back from 2-0 down at Brighton to draw 2-2 Fulham beat Brentford 3-1 in an all-West London clash at Craven Cottage Wolves continued their miserable early season form, taking a 1-0 lead before slumping to a 3-1 defeat at home to Leeds The pressure on Graham Potter mounts as his West Ham side lost 2-1 at home against Crystal Palace Burnley drew with Nottingham Forest, meaning Ange Postecoglou is still seeking his first win since taking over from Nuno Espírito Santo A number of high-profile figures paid tribute to Beard after news of his passing broke last night. USWNT boss Emma Hayes, who took over from Beard as Chelsea manager in 2012, wrote on Instagram: ‘Can’t quite compute this. Absolutely one of the best humans. Always available for a chat, one of the good guys. A champion in the women’s game and a top bloke. So gutted for his family.’ Arsenal and Canada forward Olivia Smith, who Beard signed at Liverpool wrote that she ‘wouldn’t be where I am without you.’ Aston Villa forward Rachel Daly, who was managed by Beard at West Ham added: ‘Absolutely heartbreaking. A truly special man with a heart of gold. RIP Beardy.’ England striker Alessia Russo described Beard as the ‘Warmest guy with the biggest heart.’ Matt Beard, former manager of Liverpool Women, dies aged 47 Unfortunately I have to start the day with the tragic news of the death of Matt Beard, the manager who guided Liverpool to two Women’s Super League titles in his first spell at the club and took them back to the top flight after returning for a second term. The club confirmed the passing of the 47 year old in a statement on Saturday evening: “Liverpool Football Club is deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of former LFC Women manager Matt Beard. The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Matt’s family and friends at this devastating time. “Matt was not only an extremely committed and successful manager, he was also a person of real integrity and warmth, who will always be remembered with genuine fondness by everyone he worked with at the club.” Beard’s wife, Deb, wrote on social media: “It is with great sadness that our beautiful Matthew Beard has passed away tonight [Saturday] at 7.28pm. He is a loving husband, father, son, brother and uncle. He was the most amazing, caring man who was loved by anyone who had the pleasure to meet him. “All of our family kindly ask for time to grieve in peace at his loss. We will love you forever, you absolute legend.” Our thoughts are with Beard’s family and friends at this incredibly sad time. Good morning and welcome to Sunday’s Matchday live, where we will be building up to three matches in the Premier League today, including the heavyweight clash between Arsenal and Manchester City at 4.30pm (BST). Before then we have two fixtures in the early slot, Bournemouth v Newcastle and Sunderland v Aston Villa. Manchester United v Arsenal is certainly the pick of the four games in the WSL today, that’s a 2.50pm (BST) kick-off. before then we also have Brighton v West Ham, Chelsea v Leicester and Aston Villa v Liverpool. I shall be bringing you team news and buildup to all of those fixtures, plus other bits from the world of football, as well as taking your emails and comments, so get in touch via the link at the top of the page or below the line at the bottom.\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/21/arsenal-v-manchester-city-buildup-rome-derby-and-wsl-action-matchday-live\",\n            \"category\": \"Football\",\n            \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-21T09:39:26.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 562,\n            \"title\": \"World Athletics Championships 2025: Keely Hodgkinson goes for gold in 800m and more – live\",\n            \"body\": \"こんにちは – kon’nichiwa – and welcome to the World Athletics Championships – night nine! I’m afraid we’re here: after this, it’s over. But what a way to go out! We begin with the women’s high jump and what should be a really entertaining tussle between Nicola Olyslagers, the best in the world this year – so far – and Yeroslava Mahuchikh, the Olympic champion and world record-holder. And what a race comes next! Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic 800m champion, went a year without racing after winning in Paris, resting then injured. But she’s looked pretty useful in qualifying, knows she can deliver when the pressure is at its most revolting, and has run faster than anyone in the field, ever and also this year; she’s the favourite for a reason. However there are howevers, one of which comes in the shape of her teammate and roommate, Georgia Hunter Bell. Having dropped down from the 1500, in which she won Olympic bronze, she doesn’t have Hodgkinson’s raw speed, but her speed endurance might just compensate, and we can be sure that so keen a tactician will have a plan. Meantime, looking to supplant both is Audrey Werro, a 21-year-old Swiss still exploring the extent of her talent. It might be one championship too soon for her to take gold, but it might also be the time she announces herself to the world. After that comes the men’s 5000m, a wide-open scuffle with Grant Fisher its most likely winner. Jakub Ingebrigtsen, undercooked in the 1500m, also didn’t impress in qualifying at this distance, with the various others in the shake-up too numerous to list here. Or, in other words, this should be a lot of fun with a potentially surprising winner. Next up is the men’s discuss final, after which come our relay finals and the poor old decathletes dragging their exhausted carcasses through three-and-three-quarter laps of the track, because what else would no one want to do after nine events in two days.

Directors are best off ignoring the Friar’s observation “they stumble that run fast” and Ellie Hurt rightly puts pedal to the metal in her vigorous production. Not for nothing is Zoe West’s Romeo wearing Nike trainers. The first act is breathtaking, the adrenaline sustained right from the opening brawl through to the Capulets’ ball. Romeo’s reflections on Rosaline with Benvolio (Kelise Gordon-Harrison) are fizzier than usual; the Nurse (Ebony Feare) is hurried out of giving her lament for Susan; and instead of trying to calm tempers, Joe Alessi’s hard-nut Capulet is ready to glass Tybalt (Milo McCarthy) with a bottle of bubbly. As the party rages, Mercutio (Elliot Broadfoot) grabs the mic to reprise lines from the Queen Mab speech like it’s a dance anthem, Mab’s drumming of a soldier’s ear turned into clubby beats. When Juliet (Alicia Forde) and Romeo find themselves alone together, everything grinds to a halt and the stage at last falls silent. Their shared sonnet is delivered tenderly yet with a wholly realistic adolescent awkwardness. Teenage viewers who find the delicate wooing of rhyming couplets unrelatable may take heart from this Romeo’s drunken belch beforehand – and recognise the mutual blushes and hesitant touches that follow. Then the giddiness of their first kiss propels the play onwards again, with a beautifully managed balcony scene fired by nervous excitement. There’s a fresh realism given, too, to Romeo’s discovery of his new love’s identity: “Is she a Capulet? Oh for fuck’s sake!” The streamlined text and dramaturgy by Tommo Fowler add to the pace, as do Dom Coyote’s compelling music and Sascha Gilmour’s unfussy, split-level set. The first prologue takes place as if in the tomb, the cast forming a chorus who carry vials, and the lovers’ death bed remains on stage throughout. The usual extraneous characters and speeches are excised (alas poor Balthasar!) but so too are the roles of Lady Capulet and Romeo’s parents altogether. Those are somewhat compensated by the Nurse and the Friar but you lose a sense of broader familial tragedy, as well as the elder generation’s implication in the cycle of violence. The slashed dramatis personae also reduces the effect of bustling households at war. The violence, sometimes accompanied by KJ’s strobe lighting, needs a little more edge although it is an inspired move to intercut Tybalt and Mercutio’s deaths with Juliet’s forceful “Gallop apace” soliloquy for added dynamism. This Tybalt is not an outlandish Prince of Cats but seems grimly committed to an inherited hatred he does not fully comprehend. McCarthy doubles as a dim, deluded Paris while Alessi makes a callous Capulet (given many of his absent wife’s lines) who is dripped in bling and overly concerned with status. The care for these young lovers comes from Feare’s playful Nurse and the practical Friar (Eithne Browne) as well as a soothing chorus who repurpose phrases from speeches into song lyrics. Hurt’s timings are on point until the end, as Juliet awakes to see Romeo’s drugs take hold – a scene that brings to bear all of the vulnerability and devotion in West and Forde’s performances throughout. They’re a dream pairing in an often enthralling, intelligent and accessible show. • At Everyman theatre, Liverpool, until 4 October\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/sep/21/romeo-and-juliet-review-everyman-theatre-liverpool\",\n            \"category\": \"Stage\",\n            \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-21T09:30:39.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 564,\n            \"title\": \"Keir Starmer set to announce UK recognition of Palestine later today - UK politics live \",\n            \"body\": \"After calling for criminal sanctions against Elon Musk, Ed Davey also insisted the Lib Dems are a party of free speech. Asked whether his party share the values of those who joined the Unite The Kingdom march, Davey said he thought far right rally organiser Tommy Robinson’s core group of supporters were “abhorrent”. But speaking about the wider crowd, he said: They’re protesting about the problems in the local NHS. They’re protesting about the costs of living and maybe free speech as well. But guess what? We’re a party of free speech, where a party wants to tackle the cost-of-living problems. In some other news, Ed Davey, the Lib Dems leader, has branded Elon Musk a criminal over remarks he made at the “Unite the Kingdom” rally in London last week. Addressing the crowds last Saturday via video link, Musk, the owner of X, said: “I think there’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration. “This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn’t get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. “They don’t want that, they’re quiet, they just go about their business. “My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You’re in a fundamental situation here. “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.” Asked by Sky News’ Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme if he thought the billionaire was a criminal, Davey replied: Yes. Not just because of the awful things he’s done, inciting violence. For example, he says a civil war in our country is inevitable, that our democratically elected government should be overthrown. They were bad enough. But on his platform, there are examples of adverts pushing people on self-harm, on grooming, even selling videos showing paedophile acts, child sex abuse acts. And I think he should be held to account for them. Him personally and his business. Ofcom now have the powers under the Online Safety Act… I know that is a new act and maybe we need to give them a bit more time but I personally think they need the encouragement and the support to take on powerful people and we shouldn’t just let powerful people get away with it. Scotland’s first minister John Swinney has welcomed the UK recognition of a Palestinian state as a “historic moment” but said it must not be conditional and must be backed by sanctions on Israel. His comments come after a UN commission last week said it had reasonable grounds to conclude Israel is committing a genocide against the Palestinian population in Gaza, a charge Israel denies despite the overwhelming evidence supporting it (you can read more about the commission’s findings here). The UN independent international commission of inquiry (COI) cited the killing of civilians and children in a “scorched-earth military strategy”, starvation and deaths caused by restrictions on food and medicines, mistreatment of detainees, forced displacement and the physical devastation of much of the territory to support its conclusion. In comments carried by the PA news agency, Swinney said: The recognition of a Palestinian state is a historic moment which should have come long ago. I welcome this long-awaited recognition but stress that it must not be conditional and it must be backed by sanctions against Israel. In addition to the recognition of the State of Palestine, Israel must agree to a ceasefire and allow humanitarian aid to flow freely to address the starvation being faced in Gaza. A two-state solution is the only way that the Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace, prosperity and security. I am proud to be attending an event to mark the recognition of the State of Palestine and will continue to do all that I can to support those suffering in Gaza and the West Bank. David Lammy has also been on the BBC, speaking to Laura Kuenssberg on her Sunday morning programme. Lammy is asked about what he would say to the families of Israeli hostages who say recognising Palestinian statehood is ill-judged and seriously complicates efforts to bring their loved ones home. The deputy prime minister, who has repeatedly called for the hostages being held by Hamas to be released, said he continues to meet with hostage families. He added: Hamas is not the Palestinian people. A Palestinian state is a just cause, and our country, 108 years ago, signed up to the Balfour Declaration, we believe in a homeland for the Jewish people, but we also stated that we believed in the civil and religious rights of the Palestinian people, and now is the time to stand up for that two states. Otherwise you are effectively saying you believe in no state for the Palestinian people or one state in which you would have to explain how there is proper equality before the law for the Palestinian people. Trevor Phillips pressed David Lammy over whether or not there will be any conditions for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group Israel says are being rewarded by the British government’s plan to recognise Palestinian statehood. Lammy said: We have been crystal clear. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. There can be no role for Hamas, actually, as a consequence of the decision that we made back at the end of July, we saw the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League be crystal clear that there can be no role for Hamas the first time they had done that. So we’re absolutely clear they are terrorists, they should release the hostages. That is unequivocal. But notwithstanding that Trevor, and this is an important point, when we talk about a Palestinian state, and any step to recognise it is because we wish to keep alive the prospects of a two state solution. That is what is in jeopardy. That’s not just about Gaza. It’s also about the West Bank, settler violence and expansion. Hamas, a Palestinian militant group and political movement in the Gaza Strip, has been the sole ruler in the Gaza Strip since 2007 and is designated as a terrorist organisation by many countries, including the UK, the US and Israel. Israel has said Hamas cannot have any involvement in the postwar governance of Gaza, something the British government has also said. The Palestinian Authority is an interim body that governs the occupied West Bank and recognises Israel. It is unpopular with many people living in the West Bank. Arab powers, the UK and European countries have previously signalled that they want the PA to take a central role in the administration of Gaza once Israel’s war ends, though they agree it needs reform. The deputy prime minister, David Lammy, is speaking to Sky News’ Trevor Phillips this morning on behalf of the government. Lammy, who will represent the UK at the general assembly, has said a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel “lays in tatters” after Israel carried out an airstrike on a Hamas negotiating team in Qatar at the start of the month, and the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law. Qatar, a close US ally, has been hosting negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in the Gaza war, and plays a key role as an intermediary. The former foreign secretary told Sky News: Well, since that announcement in July, in fact, with the attack on Qatar, a ceasefire at this point lays in tatters, and the prospects are bleak. And of course, we’ve also seen Israel move forward with an E1 development which would run a coach and horses between both the north and south West bank and ensure that we do not get to two states. Lammy condemned Israel’s so-called E1 plan, a highly controversial and illegal project for more than 3,400 new homes which would effectively split the occupied West Bank in half. As my colleague Peter Beaumont explains in this story, the plan would extend the existing Jewish settlement of Ma’ale Adumim towards Jerusalem, further cutting occupied east Jerusalem from the West Bank, and further separating the north and south of the territory. Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich – who backs both the plan and the imposition of Israeli sovereignty through the occupied West Bank – gloated that he believed construction on E1 would “bury the idea of a Palestinian state”. The Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has done a useful explainer with a section looking at what recognising Palestine would look like in practice. Here is an extract: Recognition is largely symbolic. When the UK’s position was announced the then foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “It will not change the position on the ground.” But it allows the UK to enter treaties with Palestine and would mean that the Palestine head of mission becomes a fully recognised ambassador. Some argue that a greater onus would be placed on the UK to boycott goods imported into the UK by Israel that come from the occupied territories. But it is seen more as a statement on Palestine’s future, and disapproval of Israel’s refusal to negotiate a Palestinian state… There are genuine fears that Israel is about to annex the West Bank or make Gaza so uninhabitable that Palestinians are forced over the borders into Jordan or Egypt, so destroying the possibility of a Palestinian homeland. Recognition that Palestine is a state with the right to self-determination is an attempt to show Israel cannot simply annex land that the international court of justice has declared to be illegally occupied. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to announce the UK’s recognition of a Palestinian state in a statement on Sunday afternoon, despite fierce Israeli opposition and US pressure to reconsider. Starmer said in July he would recognise Palestinian statehood before the UN general assembly in New York this month if Israel did not meet a series of conditions to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a long-term peace process leading to a Palestinian state coexisting alongside Israel. But Israel’s continued restrictions on aid into the devastated territory, causing starvation in parts of the Strip, the IDF’s relentless bombardments, killing a high number of civilians and destroying much of Gaza’s infrastructure, and Israel’s expanded assault on famine-stricken Gaza City, which has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee, has made the government feel like taking stronger action – no matter how symbolic – is necessary. The UK government is also said to be alarmed at plans to accelerate Israeli settlements in the West Bank which ministers fear will end any hope of a two-state solution. High-level meetings at the UN summit involving world leaders begin on 23 September. In a rare diplomatic break with Washington, Starmer has found himself at odds with the Trump administration over the move, which is opposed to giving official recognition to the state. Portugal’s foreign ministry said on Friday that it would also formally declare its recognition for Palestinian statehood on Sunday. Lisbon had already announced in July that it intended to do so, citing the “extremely worrying evolution of the conflict”. Similar moves have been made by Australia, Canada, Luxembourg and France. The Israeli government says that recognition rewards Hamas’ terrorism. Labour has sought to stress that recognition of a Palestinian state is not a reward for Hamas, and emphasised that it would have no role in the future governance of Gaza. It is expected the government will ratchet up sanctions on Hamas in due course, and it has stepped up demands for the release of hostages. Family members of some of the hostages taken by Hamas during its attack on southern Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, urged Starmer to hold off from recognition until the 48 still in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to still be alive, had been returned safely. The letter said: Your regrettable announcement of the UK’s intention to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations general assembly has dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones. Hamas has already celebrated the UK’s decision as a victory and reneged on a ceasefire deal. We write to you with a simple plea – do not take this step until our loved ones are home and in our arms.\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/21/keir-starmer-palestine-recognition-announcement-gaza-uk-politics-live\",\n            \"category\": \"Politics\",\n            \"source\": \"The Guardian\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-21T09:13:39.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 471,\n            \"title\": \"For Erika Kirk, a Husband’s Life Cut Short by Violence He Seemed to Foresee\",\n            \"body\": \"In an interview, the wife of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk said she had implored him to wear a bulletproof vest.

The majority of the players in the Liverpool squad played for Matt Beard last season and given the shock news of death it would be very understandable if they felt unable to play. Hopefully any Liverpool fans who had set off for Birmingham hadn’t made it too far with their journey. Following the tragic death of former manager Matt Beard, Liverpool have released a short statement confirming that their WSL clash with Aston Villa, which was due to take place at midday, has been postponed. Here is the statement in full: Following the sudden and tragic news of the passing of former LFC Women manager Matt Beard, the match at Villa Park – scheduled for 12pm BST – will not take place. Details of a rearrangement will be confirmed in due course. I’ve had a little trip below the line, hello you lovely lot, this comment piqued my interest: Do you Gooners feel Duderonomy is deluded? I don’t. Send me your thoughts via the link at the top or keep them coming in the comments. Marseille v PSG: a rivalry that is more about old records than recent results For Le Classique, we have a great read from the Guardian Sport Network as Luke Entwistle of Get French Football News writes about how PSG have now snatched the last bragging right away from Marseille fans. Even as the Parisians were racking up league titles, OM could always say they were France’s only European champions, but not any more… Read Luke Entwistle’s full preview via the link below There are some absolutely massive games across Europe today. We will be providing goal updates from the Rome derby in this blog when that kicks off at 11.30am BST. We will get team news from the Stadio Olimpico in about an hour. There is also Le Classique tonight (7.45pm BST) in Ligue 1 as Marseille host PSG at Stade Velodrome, that will be some spectacle. Roberto De Zerbi’s collection of former Premier League talents have been troublingly inconsistent so far this season, PSG have four wins from four games, still it’s at the Velodrome. In Spain, Barcelona already have ground to make up on Real Madrid, who continued their perfect start to the season last night by beating Espanyol 2-0. Marcus Rashford reminded everyone why he plays for Barcelona at Newcastle in midweek, he will be hoping for more of the same against Getafe tonight (8pm BST). To the Bundesliga where Harry Kane scored another hat-trick (although the German I’m not sure it met the slightly baffling criteria for a hat-trick in Germany) as Bayern Munich won 4-1 at Hoffenheim. Should Borussia Dortmund want to hang on to the coattails of the Bavarians they will need to overcome Wolfsburg at Signal Iduna Park, where Christian Eriksen could make his debut for the visitors (6.30pm BST). The first email of the blog today comes from krishnamoorthy v, who writes: Hello Tom, How often does one get to see a Arsenal-City clash in which the latter is the underdog? If Arsenal blow this, as usual, then they may have to resign to the old saying, slightly adapted: ‘Class is temporary, but second place is permanent’. While I would argue that Arsenal in the past few seasons have always been considered at least the bookies’ favourite going into home matches against City, but I think the spirit of the question still stands. So, on that, the City malaise that set in last season has removed that aura of invincibility and having seen them in person this season, they simly aren’t as scary as they used to be. I don’t think even a defeat would consign Arsenal to second, but they do need to come out and attack this game. If it turns it into a battle of set-pieces and fine margins then it will be closer than it should be, whereas an early assault could demoralise a fragile City side that are yet to truly convince. Manchester United’s fast WSL start can’t mask growing apathy and frustration Manchester United sit top of the Women’s Super League, albeit two games in. A 3-1 aggregate win over the Norwegian side Brann on Thursday ensured they escaped the Champions League qualifying stage for the first time. The new signing Jess Park has hit the ground running. Elisabeth Terland has scored two hat-tricks. This should be fuelling positivity and hope, but not even the impressive start can cut through the cloud of disillusionment and frustration felt by fans and those watching the club from further afield. Why does this growing apathy exist? Why, even if United beat the European champions, Arsenal, at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday, will it not go away? In part, because of a feeling of missed opportunity. United have, arguably, overachieved, regularly challenging at the top of the WSL and reaching three FA Cup finals in the past three years, winning the competition in 2024. They are operating on a much smaller budget than Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City and their potential is being harmed by an ownership that appears not to care. Read Suzanne Wrack’s full preview of Manchester United v Arsenal via the link below For the showpiece fixture in the WSL this afternoon between Manchester United and Arsenal, the excellent Emillia Hawkins will be bringing you full live coverage, we shall where you can find that blog as soon as it goes live. As noted earlier, there are three midday (BST) kick-offs in the WSL and you will be able to get updates on all the goals in this very blog with my esteemed colleague John Brewin, so don’t go anywhere. I will bring you team news from those as soon as it lands, hot and fresh off from the various inkjet printers across the country. Arteta to stick with impressive Mosquera? The praise has been flooding in for Cristhian Mosquera after his impressive performance against Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday. “He’s still so young,” said Jurriën Timber after Arsenal’s 2-0 win. “It looks so easy for him, winning his duels and on the ball as well. It’s great to have him next to me, and he has a bright future as well.” Signed from Valencia for an initial £13m, the Spain Under-21s international looks like one of best value summer deals having filled in admirably for the injured William Saliba. The Frenchman has been back in training this week after limping off at Liverpool with an ankle injury before the international break. The question is whether Mikel Arteta will bring Saliba back or stick with Mosquera for the meeting with Manchester City. Arsenal v Manchester City, 4.30pm Roefs’ excellence bars Villa’s path Will Sunday’s trip to the Stadium of Light prove to be the start of a positive reset for Aston Villa? Or could it signal the beginning of the biggest crisis of Unai Emery’s tenure? Emery’s cause would be aided appreciably if his side could score a first league goal of the season. The only problem is that Sunderland have collected seven points from their opening four league games and possess the outstanding Robin Roefs in goal. They say there are no steals in the European transfer market any more but the 22-year-old cost a modest initial £9m, potentially rising to £11.5m, when Sunderland signed him from NEC Nijmegen this summer. On the convincing evidence of his first four games it is no surprise that a keeper who has played for the Netherlands at every junior level and starred for the under-21s in the recent European Championship has now graduated to the Dutch senior squad. Sunderland v Aston Villa, 2pm Handling Woltemade is a tall order Three-quarters of Bournemouth’s first-choice defence departed the club this summer in Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi but, after three wins from four, the Cherries seem stronger than ever. The ease with which the 18-year-old centre-back Veljko Milosavljevic has slotted in alongside his partner Marcos Senesi has been striking; the new signing signed for the club on deadline day and made only 27 first-team appearances for Red Star Belgrade before his £13m move to the Premier League. Milosavljevic marshalled Danny Welbeck and Stefanos Tzimas expertly in the win against Brighton but if the Serb retains his place ahead of another of Bournemouth’s new additions, Bafodé Diakité, he faces a different prospect altogether in Nick Woltemade. The 6ft 6in Newcastle striker showed against Wolves he is an aerial threat and a nimble forward able to link the play, somewhere between a classic No 9 and a second striker. Containing the big German will be key in deciding if Bournemouth continue their excellent start. Bournemouth v Newcastle, 2pm Here’s a few preview notes on today’s Premier League fixtures from our team of writers… Andoni Iraola is a model modern manager. Could he save Manchester United? You have to be patient with new players. You have to give a manager time to work with fresh signings, let them learn his methods. Rome wasn’t built in a day – Brian Clough quipped he wasn’t on that particular job, but it took until the third season at Derby and Nottingham Forest to win promotion. It makes sense; you have to wait. Football takes time. Or you could just turn to Andoni Iraola. Iraola lost three of his back four in the summer and his goalkeeper. (No detail perhaps so encapsulates the financial landscape of modern European football better than the highest fees paid in the latest transfer window by a Spanish club and a French one were for Bournemouth centre-backs. His third-highest non-penalty goalscorer from last season left as well. The expectation might have been of a season, at least a few weeks, of transition, but Bournemouth have, for the first time in the top flight, won three of their first four games. Read Jonathan Wilson’s full ‘Inside football’ column via the link below After such tragic news, your regular football fodder feels rather trite, but there was action on the field yesterday, including a win for Liverpool’s men’s team in Merseyside derby against Everton. Here’s a quick recap: Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitike scored to in that 2-1 win over Everton that maintains Liverpool’s perfect start to the season Jack Grealish and David Moyes criticised referee Darren England over the amount of stoppage time in the derby A fiery clash at Old Trafford saw Manchester United beat Chelsea 2-1, in game where Robert Sanchez was dismissed after five minutes and Casemiro scored before later seeing red himself Spurs fought back from 2-0 down at Brighton to draw 2-2 Fulham beat Brentford 3-1 in an all-West London clash at Craven Cottage Wolves continued their miserable early season form, taking a 1-0 lead before slumping to a 3-1 defeat at home to Leeds The pressure on Graham Potter mounts as his West Ham side lost 2-1 at home against Crystal Palace Burnley drew with Nottingham Forest, meaning Ange Postecoglou is still seeking his first win since taking over from Nuno Espírito Santo A number of high-profile figures paid tribute to Beard after news of his passing broke last night. USWNT boss Emma Hayes, who took over from Beard as Chelsea manager in 2012, wrote on Instagram: ‘Can’t quite compute this. Absolutely one of the best humans. Always available for a chat, one of the good guys. A champion in the women’s game and a top bloke. So gutted for his family.’ Arsenal and Canada forward Olivia Smith, who Beard signed at Liverpool wrote that she ‘wouldn’t be where I am without you.’ Aston Villa forward Rachel Daly, who was managed by Beard at West Ham added: ‘Absolutely heartbreaking. A truly special man with a heart of gold. RIP Beardy.’ England striker Alessia Russo described Beard as the ‘Warmest guy with the biggest heart.’ Matt Beard, former manager of Liverpool Women, dies aged 47 Unfortunately I have to start the day with the tragic news of the death of Matt Beard, the manager who guided Liverpool to two Women’s Super League titles in his first spell at the club and took them back to the top flight after returning for a second term. The club confirmed the passing of the 47 year old in a statement on Saturday evening: “Liverpool Football Club is deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of former LFC Women manager Matt Beard. The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Matt’s family and friends at this devastating time. “Matt was not only an extremely committed and successful manager, he was also a person of real integrity and warmth, who will always be remembered with genuine fondness by everyone he worked with at the club.” Beard’s wife, Deb, wrote on social media: “It is with great sadness that our beautiful Matthew Beard has passed away tonight [Saturday] at 7.28pm. He is a loving husband, father, son, brother and uncle. He was the most amazing, caring man who was loved by anyone who had the pleasure to meet him. “All of our family kindly ask for time to grieve in peace at his loss. We will love you forever, you absolute legend.” Our thoughts are with Beard’s family and friends at this incredibly sad time. Good morning and welcome to Sunday’s Matchday live, where we will be building up to three matches in the Premier League today, including the heavyweight clash between Arsenal and Manchester City at 4.30pm (BST). Before then we have two fixtures in the early slot, Bournemouth v Newcastle and Sunderland v Aston Villa. Manchester United v Arsenal is certainly the pick of the four games in the WSL today, that’s a 2.50pm (BST) kick-off. before then we also have Brighton v West Ham, Chelsea v Leicester and Aston Villa v Liverpool.
